                <h1>Learning VM Setup</h1>

<a id=""><h2>About the Learning Virtual Machine</h2></a>

<p>The Learning Virtual Machine (VM) is a sandbox environment for you to play with and learn about Puppet Enterprise. The VM is powered by CentOS Linux and for your convenience, we've already pre-installed Puppet Enterprise (PE) onto the VM. To get started with learning about Puppet Enterprise, we first need to get the VM running. </p>

<p>The Learning VM comes in two flavors - a VMware version that is suitable for VMware Player or VMware Workstation on Linux and Windows based machines, and VMware Fusion for Mac, as well an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) file that is suitable for all virtualization players that support it. In this case we recommend Oracle's Virtualbox. </p>

<a id=""><h2>Getting started with the Learning VM</h2></a>

<p>In order to get started, we need to open the file with the appropriate virtualization software. If you haven't already downloaded VMware Player, VMware Workstation, or Oracle Virtualbox, please see the linked below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer">VMWare Player</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We will need to ssh to the Learning VM, and Putty is a free SSH client for Windows. If you are using a Windows computer, please also download <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty</a>. </p>

<p>Once that is complete, please follow the instructions in the following sections.</p>

<h3>VMware Setup</h3>

<p>Before we get started, please ensure you have an up-to-date installation of your VMware virtualization software. Once you're certain everything is up to date, open the <em>.vmx</em>  file you extracted from the VMware VM zip file, change the Network Adapter to use a Bridged connection, tweak the memory settings (we recommend increasing), and finally, power on the VM. If at any point, you are not sure or want to start from scratch, you can delete the files extracted from the zip archive, and start over again by extracting the files from the archive.</p>

<p>For the rest of this guide, the instructions are for VMware Fusion. However, this should assist you in using VMware Player or Workstation as well.</p>

<p>From the VMWare <strong>File</strong> menu, select <strong>Open</strong> and navigate to the .vmx file included in your Learning VM download. You can also drag and drop the .vmx file into the VMWare virtual machine library.</p>

<p>Don't launch the VM just yet; we'll want to adjust a couple of settings first. With the Learning VM selected in the VMWare library, open the <strong>Settings</strong> panel and click the <strong>Network Adapter</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Autodetect</strong> under the <strong>Bridged Networking</strong> heading as shown in the example.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper">
<img src="../assets/vmware_network_bridged.png"><p>Figure</p>
</div>

<p>Next, we'll want to allocate some extra memory to the VM to ensure that it has the resources neccessary to run smoothly. Go back to the <strong>Settings</strong> panel and click the <strong>Processors &amp; Memory</strong> icon. We suggest allocating at least two gigabytes of memory. Use the slider to set your memory allocation. Note that the Learning VM will likely still function with less memory allocated, but you may encounter performance issues.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper">
<img src="../assets/vmware_memory.png"><p>Figure</p>
</div>

<p>Now that your settings are configured, click the <strong>Power On</strong> button to boot up the VM.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">NOTE: Virtualization software uses mouse and keyboard capture to 'own' these devices and communicate input to the guest operating system. The keystroke to release the mouse and keyboard will be displayed at the top right of the VM window.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the VM is powered up, skip ahead to the Next Steps section below.</p>

<h3>VirtualBox Setup</h3>

<p>Be sure you have an up-to-date installation of VirtualBox. The Learning VM works best with VirtualBox 4.x. If you don't have VirtualBox 4.x, please get you <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">free download</a> of the latest version.</p>

<p>Choose “Import Appliance” from the File menu and select the .ovf file included with your download.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Do not</strong> use the “New Virtual Machine Wizard” and select the included .vmdk file as the disk; machines created this way will kernel panic during boot. </p>

<p>Don't launch the VM just yet; we'll want to adjust a couple of settings first. </p>

<p>In the VirtualBox Manager panel, select <strong>Network</strong> to access networking options. Choose <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper">
<img src="./assets/vbox_network_bridged.png"><p>Figure</p>
</div>

<p>For everything to work smoothly, we suggest allocating at least two gigabytes of memory to the VM. In the VirtualBox Manager panel, click <strong>System</strong> to access the system options and use the slider to set your memory allocation. Note that the Learning VM will likely still function with less memory allocated, but you may encounter performance issues.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper">
<img src="./assets/vbox_memory.png"><p>Figure</p>
</div>

<p>Now that everything is configured, click the <strong>Start</strong> button in the upper left to boot up the VM.</p>

<p>Note: Refer to <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual">VirtualBox documentation</a> for additional information as required.</p>

<p>Once the VM is powered up in VirtualBox, follow the Next Steps below:</p>

<a id=""><h2>Next Steps</h2></a>

<p>Once you have the VM running, log into it using the following credentials:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Login Username: root</li>
<li>Password: puppet</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are logged in, please make a note of the IP address. You'll need this to access the VM via SSH. If you forget the IP address, or if it changes, you can access it again by entering the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">    ifconfig
</code></pre></div>
<p>The IP address will be listed as the <code>inet addr</code> for the <code>eth0</code> interface. For example:</p>

<div class="img-wrapper">
<img src="./assets/setup_ifconfig.png"><p>Figure</p>
</div>

<p>The IP address for the VM in the above example is: <strong>192.168.16.135</strong>. Please note that the IP address for your VM will be different.</p>

<p>One more thing before we are done. To ensure you have the best experience, and the quest progress tracking works as expected, you need to <strong>logout from the VM</strong>.</p>

<p>Type the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">exit
</code></pre></div>
<p>and press enter, in the VM.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to learn more about Puppet using the installation of Puppet Enterprise on the VM. Please continue following the rest of the Quest Guide. We hope you have fun learning Puppet!</p>
